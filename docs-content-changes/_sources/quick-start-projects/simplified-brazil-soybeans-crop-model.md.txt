# Simplified Brazil Soybeans Crop Model

See the [Simplified Brazil Soybeans Crop Model](https://gro-intelligence.com/gro-showcase/brazil-soybeans-showcase) example in the [Gro Showcase](https://gro-intelligence.com/gro-showcase) for a longer, more detailed demonstration of many of the API's capabilities in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

This notebook demonstrates the `CropModel` class and its `compute_crop_weighted_series()` method in action. In this example, NDVI ([normalized difference vegetation index](https://app.gro-intelligence.com/dictionary/items/321)) for provinces in Brazil is weighted against each province's historical soybean production to put the latest NDVI values into context.
