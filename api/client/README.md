# Gro API Library and Client Classes

* The [lib module](lib.py) contains all of the base functions for accessing the Gro API.
* The [Client class](__init__.py) provides those library functions with stateful authentication.
* The [GroClient class](gro_client.py) extends the Client class and adds extra utility functions. This is the recommended class for most users.
* The [samples/](samples/) directory contains example scripts and models using the Gro API that you can run for yourself.
