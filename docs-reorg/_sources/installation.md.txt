# Installation

Now that you have downloaded the base system requirements, you will need to install the packages for the Gro API Client.

Install with pip install

```
pip install git+https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client.git
```
Note: even if you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), the API Client install should still be performed using pip and not [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

Note: to find the location where Gro packages have been installed you can use the query:
```
pip show gro
```
To ensure that you have the latest client version with newest features, you can use the following command.

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client.git
```
